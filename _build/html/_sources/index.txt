JPCDI's Software Installation Guides
====================================

These how-to guides - at least - started off as a personal means of documenting my way through my media server installations, so I wouldn't have to hop around the net near as much. Now, I've got most of it published, copied and edited with my personal touch here on my site.

If you have any suggestions for improvements, wanna submit edits, or just wanna leave a nice comment, please go see my `github page <https://github.com/jpartain89/software-install-guides>`_ and send me pull requests or submit an issue.

A lot of my guides have been copied from `HTPC Guides <https://htpcguides.com>`_. This site is wonderful with a wealth of info, and is constantly updated with information and new guides.
