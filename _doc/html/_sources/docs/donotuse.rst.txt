.. note::

  These directions are way out of date. Do not use these!
  I have since switched to a different process or tool since writing this particular article, but keeping it up for posterities sake, until I can properly replace it.

What have I changed to you ask?
Anything building I've tried switching over to Ansible to handle in a much more programatic way.
Others might be tools that I just don't use at all anymore, due to changing DNS hosts.
