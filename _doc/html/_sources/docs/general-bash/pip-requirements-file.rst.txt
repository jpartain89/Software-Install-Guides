pip Requirements File
=====================

tl;dr  a pip Requirements File is a list of programs "required" to be installed. Lets say you have a program you wrote that has required python programs, you'd include them here.

I personally use the requirements file as a simple ``install/upgrade`` list. aka:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo -H pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

This file is much more detailed and expansive than I care to currently go into.
