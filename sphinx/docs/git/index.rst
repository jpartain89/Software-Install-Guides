This is not, in any way, meant to be exhaustive - or even highly detailed or maybe even very correct - guide on using your Git command line tools. This is, to be honest, mostly a means of a personal notebook to start. Though, I've found when I start it that way, it can turn into something better, different, than originally intended.
