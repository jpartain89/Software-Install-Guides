Intro to Bash
===============

This, starting off, is my attempt at helping newbies to the terminal - and bash in general - get some sort of grasp at the beginnings of learning.

I know all too well how difficult it can be to really grasp these beginning steps, and how daunting it all can seem. There is a ton of information out on the internet, and not only finding the right info but knowing which sites and which comments to trust can be just as difficult as anything else.

Honestly, starting off with a good foundation of simply knowing how to search and using google to your advantage is an amazing baseline to have for, well, anything.
