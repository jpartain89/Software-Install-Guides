Cloudflare DDNS
================

If you're using Cloudflare, with a residential internet setup, your IP address is likely to change at random, at any time. What is a person to do about your web address still pointing to the correct IP address when it changes? The best open source option always has been `ddclient`_. But, now there is a docker container for updating your DNS registration to always point to your public IP address.
