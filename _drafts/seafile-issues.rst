SeaFile Ownership Issues
=========================

Currently, there is some major funny business going on with Seafile - the self-hosted file storage, syncing and sharing software.

Evidently, there were two groups of developers working on SeaFile together. One from Germany and one from China.

SeaFile started in 2012, with SeaFile LTD., the Chinese-based company. Then, JacksonIT out of Germany became a reseller, local help-desk, and ran a public forum. In 2015, JacksonIT switched to SeaFile GmbH, and registered to be an official face to SeaFile in Europe in general.

So now we have:

- SeaFile LTD. out of China - Original Owners
- SeaFile GmbH out of Germany

And this is where the explanations split, and its difficult to figure out who is truthful, at least to me.

SeaFile LTD. says that the plan was to move the "Pro Software Sales" side of SeaFile GmbH to SeaFile LTD., where shares of SeaFile LTD. would be the compensation for the transfer. And SeaFile GmbH would change to SeaFile Cloud GmbH, and become only a Hosted Cloud Provider using SeaFile. Supposedly, according to SeaFile LTD., GmbH wanted too many shares, so the contract fell through. But, here is where they say GmbH began "to secretly try to gain ownership of the Seafile project, without our notice."

[SeaFile LTD.'s 2nd 7/22/16 Blog Post] (https://blogs.seafile.com/2016/07/22/future-development-plan-of-seafile/)

Now, [SeaFile GmbH's post](https://seafile.de/en/about-the-future-of-seafile/) is a short, to-the-point announcement of whats happened and a little bit of why:

"* the current development race
* erratic changes of public plans
* beta testing on paying customers
* removal of features without proper prior notification or migration plans and
* disrespect towards data privacy when it comes to German or European law."

[This post,](https://seafile.de/en/about-the-statements-made-by-seafile-ltd/) posted 3 days later, is much MUCH more detailed in their reasoning, along with what they did as well. Though, sadly, they were ever-so-slightly light on the dates and timelines of happenings.

When you read through all 4 posts - or, at least for me - the conclusions drawn are, at the least fairly vague. Its difficult, without more thorough research and questioning, to determine which side to trust or even which code to use. Because, this is the real crux of the issue:

> We're using this code to be the front gate to our personal information. And without thorough research in the code, doing the fun due-diligence of making sure our stuff doesn't leave our control, how on earth can we in any way trust either side at this point?

And what pisses me off the most?? In my personal attempts to find software to handle what I've been wanting as file storing software, this one was just about perfection for me!!!

UGH
