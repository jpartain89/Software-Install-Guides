title: Don't forget about xcode-select --install
---

So, after almost 2 days now of futzing with my different terminal apps and what not, and terminal giving me issues not wanting to compile anything... I TOTALLY forgot to run `xcode-select --install`to download the new developer tools....

Moral of the story???

LOVE YOUR XCODE!
