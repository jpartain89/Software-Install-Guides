# Raspberry Pi:

To install the Domotz agent onto the monitoring hardware:

```bash
wget https://portal.domotz.com/download/agent_packages/domotz-raspberry-armhf-1.1.2-276.deb
sudo dpkg -i domotz-raspberry-armhf-1.1.2-276.deb
```

Then, wait for it to finish, and it will give you the IP address to use to link to your account.

Or, you are able to use your iPhone app, on the same network, to run the activation as well.
