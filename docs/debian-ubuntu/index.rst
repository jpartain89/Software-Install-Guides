===============
Debian / Ubuntu
===============

My old guides have now been archived, since I've moved on to using Docker for most everything at this stage.

I'm still in the process of rewritting my how-to's around my use of docker.

Take the rest of these with the knowledge that they are old.

Chapters
=========

I have this section broken down further into specific area's of interest:

#. :ref:`web_server_stuff` - This is for setting up the actual web server backend. This is the reverse proxy stuff so you can map your port numbers to web addresses for easy typing and remote access.

.. note::

  This section is in need of a major overhaul, as I have changed up my NGINX processes since this was written last.

#. :ref:`apt` - These guides are specifically geared towards Debian's ``apt-get``-based installation systems, including ``dpkg``

.. toctree::

  apt-dpkg/index
  extras/index
  ubuntu_user
