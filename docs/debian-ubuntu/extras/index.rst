============
Extra Items
============

These are Ubuntu-Specific items, apply to - usually - all of my VM's, no matter what they are being used for.

AKA:

#. :ref:`lvm` for using LVM for your drives, which I personally do not really use much anymore. I moreso use `btrfs`_
#. :ref:`postfix` for the system to be able to send emails;
#. :ref:`mounting-drive`
#. :ref:`renaming-network-devices`

.. toctree::

  lvm
  mount-drive-ubuntu
  postfix
  renaming-network-devices
  access-control-lists

.. _btrfs: https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
