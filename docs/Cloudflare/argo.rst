Cloudflared/Argo
=================

Argo, and the corresponding ``cloudflared`` program are an awesome, secure means of accessing your stuff behind your router/public IP address securely, and without you even having to setup any port forwarding! (It runs as a daemon on your server, using uPNP to open the port)

First, there's not much rhyme nor reason for me to rewrite their already-awesome 
`Getting Started <https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/quickstart/>`_ guide, but you need to go read that to get setup first.
