Updating X-Code After Big Updates
=================================

tl;dr
=====

Reminder! You need to:

.. code-block:: bash

  xcode-select --install

after a big macOS update!

So, after almost 2 days now of futzing with my different terminal apps and what not, and terminal giving me issues not wanting to compile anything... I TOTALLY forgot to run ``xcode-select --install`` to download the new developer tools.

Moral of the story?

Love your X-Code!
