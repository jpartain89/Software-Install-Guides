.. note::

  I keep all of my cloned git repos inside of one, singular directory:

  ``~/git``

  This way, I don't have to hunt all over my system for where my repo's are and it makes it easier to keep them updated. Then, I symlink the library to wherever either the developer wants/requires it or where is easiest.

  The other way of handing this is to clone your PROGRAMS into the /opt directory - so /opt/couchpotato, /opt/NzbDrone, /opt/plexpy and so on. Then clone your working repos for projects into ``~/git/[repo]``
