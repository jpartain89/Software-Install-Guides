# Software Install Guides

My personal MarkDown files for my Software Installation Guides.

The majority of these guides are the ones that I find myself, time and time again, repeatedly revisiting in order to either build, rebuild or re-aquaint myself with some point of knowledge.

Obviously, I will be doing my best to source those sites!

## Layout

I have a lot more Ubuntu-Based guides than anything else, but I do also use macOS and have a Raspberry Pi, so the guides I've typed up are over there as well.
