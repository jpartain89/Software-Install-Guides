# Software-Install-Guides

My personal MarkDown files for my Software Installation Guides.

The majority of these guides are the ones that I find myself, time and time again, repeatedly revisiting in order to either build, rebuild or re-aquaint myself with some point of knowledge.

Obviously, I will be doing my best to source those sites!
