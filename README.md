My personal MarkDown files for my Software Installation Guides.

The majority of these guides are the ones that I find myself, time and time again, repeatedly revisiting in order to either build, rebuild or re-aquaint myself with some point of knowledge.

I have these docs both self-hosted and being hosted on [ReadTheDocs.org](rtfd.io). The ReadTheDocs hosting part was a recent occurrence. Currently, my NGINX-based server is reverse-proxying out to ReadTheDocs.
