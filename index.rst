JPCDI's Software Installation Guides
====================================

These how-to guides, at least,  started off as a personal means of documenting my way through my media server installations. That way I wouldn't have to hop around the net near as much, remembering and forgetting what and where.

Plus, working on this helps to keep the documentation and sourcing fresh.

If you have any suggestions for improvements, wanna submit edits, or just wanna leave a nice comment, please visit my `Software-Install-Guides GIthub Page`_ and send me pull requests or submit an issue.

A lot of my guides have been copied from `HTPC Guides`_. This site is wonderful with a wealth of info, and is constantly updated with information and new guides.
