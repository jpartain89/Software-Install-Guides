JPCDI's Software Installation Guides
====================================

These how-to guides, at least, started off as a personal means of documenting my way through my media server installations. That way I wouldn't have to hop around the internet near as much, remembering and forgetting what and where.

Plus, working on this helps to keep the documentation and sourcing fresh.

If you have any suggestions for improvements, would like to submit edits, or just want to drop a nice comment, please visit my `Software-Install-Guides Github Page`_ and feel free to submit a pull request or an issue.

Some of my older guides have been copied from `HTPC Guides`_. This site was, at one time, a regularly updated site, but hasn't seen any activity in quite a while.
